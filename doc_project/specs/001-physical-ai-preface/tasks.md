# Preface: The Physical AI Paradigm - Tasks

## Phase 1: Research & Definition (Checkpoint)

- [ ] T001 Define "Embodied Intelligence" in research notes in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/research.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: A concise definition of "Embodied Intelligence" is present in research.md.
- [ ] T002 Define "Sim-to-Real" in research notes in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/research.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: A concise definition of "Sim-to-Real" is present in research.md.

## Phase 2: Structuring (Checkpoint)

- [ ] T003 Create Docusaurus header for preface in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The preface.md file exists and contains a valid Docusaurus header.
- [ ] T004 Create section outline for preface in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The preface.md file contains a clear, hierarchical outline for "The Core Premise", "The Method", and "The Promise" sections.

## Phase 3: Drafting (Checkpoint)

- [ ] T005 Write "The Core Premise" section in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The "Core Premise" section is drafted with complete thoughts and logical flow in preface.md.
- [ ] T006 Write "The Method" section in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The "Method" section is drafted with complete thoughts and logical flow in preface.md.
- [ ] T007 Write "The Promise" section in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The "Promise" section is drafted with complete thoughts and logical flow in preface.md.

## Phase 4: Safety & Review (Checkpoint)

- [ ] T008 Verify "Latency Trap" warning is present and clear in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The preface.md explicitly includes a warning about the "Latency Trap".
- [ ] T009 Verify "Curious Mentor" tone across preface in specs/001-physical-ai-preface/preface.md
  - **Acceptance Criterion**: The overall tone of preface.md consistently reflects a "Curious Mentor" style.

## Dependencies

Phases must be completed in sequential order. Tasks within a phase can be done in any order, or in parallel where noted.

## Parallel Execution Examples

(No specific parallel execution examples provided as most tasks have sequential dependencies within the narrative flow of writing, but tasks within a checkpoint can be reordered if no direct content dependency exists.)

## Implementation Strategy

We will proceed with an MVP-first approach, completing each phase and its associated tasks sequentially. Each checkpoint signifies a review opportunity before proceeding to the next phase.
