## Key Term Definitions

### Embodied Intelligence
Embodied Intelligence refers to AI systems, typically robots, that interact with the physical world through sensors and actuators, processing real-world physics, gravity, and friction within a "Sense-Think-Act" loop. This fundamentally contrasts with "Digital AI" like large language models, which primarily process symbolic information such as text.

### Sim-to-Real
Sim-to-Real is a critical development methodology for Physical AI, where AI models are first trained and refined within a high-fidelity digital twin environment (e.g., Isaac Sim) to mitigate risks of physical damage and accelerate learning. Once validated in simulation, these models are then deployed to real-world hardware (e.g., Jetson-powered robots with actuators).
